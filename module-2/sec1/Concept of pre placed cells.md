pre place cells:
--------------------------------- 
  cells that are placed in the core of a design before the placement and routing stages

Lets take an example of combinational logic circuit and output of the combinational logic is huge circuit

so, we cut /divide the circuit into differnt parts .

lets assume circuit is divided into two parts and we separate into two different blocks and implemented separately 
These blocks are considered as Black box .

If these blocks are replicated multiple times on the chip, We implement this block once and reused multiple times whenever it requires in the cihp.

Similarly there are other IP's are also avaliable. These are called pre-placed cells.
