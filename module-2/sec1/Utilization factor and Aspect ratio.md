Titile :Utilization factor and Aspect ratio
--------------------------------------------

In the physical design flow the first step is defining the height and width of the core

Let's take an example of basic netlist consists of two flipflops and logic gates

In this we are dependent on the dimensiions of logic gates and flipflops 

lets assume standard cells are having an area of 1sq.unit and same are for flipflops as well

If we bring all the standard cells and flip flops together and caluclate the are area gives the minium area occupied by the netlist

If we place the netlist inside the core , we have seen that netlist completely occupies the core which means it has 100% utilization  of the core 

Utilization factor is given by Area occupied by the netlist to Total Area of core 

Aspect Ratio is given by Height to the Width of the core 

Another example where the dimensions of the netlist is same and core is different 

In this case the utilization factor is 0.5
