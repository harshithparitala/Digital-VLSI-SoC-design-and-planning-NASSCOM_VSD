Timing threshold definations are reffered as points of different theshold of waveform . 

To understand the different syntax we take this graph:

BLUE- output of inverter 1 and input to inverter 2
RED- output of the buffer

Slow_low_rise_thr: it depicts value close near to zero . The typical value is 20%

Slow_high_rise_thr: it depicts value close to top power supply . The typical value is 20%

in_rise_thr: typicaly 50%
in-RED
out-BLUE
