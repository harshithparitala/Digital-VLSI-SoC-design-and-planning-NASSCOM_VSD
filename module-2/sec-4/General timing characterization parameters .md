Timming characterization:
--

characheterization setup:

Timing threshold definations are reffered as points of different theshold of waveform . 


To understand the different syntax we take this graph:

BLUE- output of inverter 1 and input to inverter 2
RED- output of the buffer

Slow_low_rise_thr: it depicts value close near to zero . The typical value is 20%
Slow_high_rise_thr: it depicts value close to top power supply . The typical value is 20%

similar for falling waveform:


in_rise_thr: typicaly 50%

in-RED
out-BLUE

simmilarly for falling wave form:
