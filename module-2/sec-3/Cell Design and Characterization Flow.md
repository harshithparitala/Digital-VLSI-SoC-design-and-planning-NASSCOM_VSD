We have the placement and routed version of the chip .If we pick up the cells over the chip ,these cells are called Standard Cells.
These Standard Cells are placed in Library

Library has different gates with different functionality but also got different cells with different sizes.These are the physical characterization of the cells

If we take a particular cell lets take an inverter it has different threshold voltages and take more time to .
