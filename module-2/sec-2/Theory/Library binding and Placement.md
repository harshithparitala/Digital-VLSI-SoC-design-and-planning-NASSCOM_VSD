Netlist Binding and Intial Place design
--
The first step in this is bind the netlist with the physical cells 
Lets say we have this netlist with all these gates,the shapes of these gates represents the functionality of the gates.

In reality we have only boxes these flipflops and logic gates are represent using boxes which has physical dimensions.The netlist will look like this if we use boxes.

If all these netlist as well as pre placed cells are present in a shell is called a library ,
library is is where we find all the information about netlist and its timing .library also has various shapes of these particular gates 

Example

 After given proper shape and sizes the next step is to take the gates and place it on floor plan
 We have the netlist and floorplan along withe pre placed cells . we place the gates in fllorplan

 In this scenario  FF1 is close to DIN and FF2 is close to DOUT , logic gates between them Simillarly we arange all three sections of netlist .

 Optimize placement:
 --
Optimization is the process of iterating through a design such that it meets timing, area and power specifications
In this we will estimate the wire length , capacitence etc.,

connecting sec-1 :

For sec 2,Between Din2 and FF1. The wire length will be area and it huge and because of huge length it will has more resistance so we will place the buffers to tramsit the signals without lossing the data ,but there is a loss of area .

Need for Charachterization:

Ic design flow:

The first step is logic synthesis which is reffered as converting the functionality into legal hardware
The output of Logic synthesis is arrangement of gates that will represents the original functionality that is designed using RTL

The next step  of logic synthesis is floorplanning and decide the size of the core and die

The next step is placemwnt we take the logic cells and place it on the chip in a fashion that initial timming is better

The next step is Clock Tree Synthesis .We place Clock tree that will take care of clock signal reaching at each and every clock end points
After this we will Route the cells .Routing step depends on the charachterization of cell

The final thing is Static Timing Analysis in which we try to find setup time, holdtime and the maximum frequency of the clock

One common thing across all the stages are "GATES or CELLS".
