What is PDK?

PDK stands for Process Design Kit 
Collection of files used to modal a fabrication process for the EDA tools used to design an IC ;
Process Design Rules: DRC,LVS,PEX

Floor and Power Planning: Partition the chip die between differnt system building blocks and place input output Pads 

for macroflooring there will be Dimensions ,PinLocations and Rows

Power Planning: Power Networks are construcetd in terms of multiple vdd and grounds ,these are connected to all components verticall or horizantal, these are having less resistance due to these are metal surfaces
